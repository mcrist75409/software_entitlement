# software_entitlement
In the design of complex engineered systems, the number of different software
packages required for the design of a system or delivery of a service can be high. Depending on
the type of work performed, individual costs for each license entitlement of software can be in
the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. For some organizations, the design and
deployment of the systems engineering environment is an important step in the design and
development of the system itself. Part of this engineering environment is the software used to
perform engineering work, the use of which is entitled through software licenses. If the
organization operates with a fixed annual budget or a budget based on the volume of work
performed, it is helpful to be able to predict the total volume of software license entitlements
needed annually or based on volume of work. 

The data in this project is actual monitoring data of software usage.  The data for one organizaiton
is currently provided.
